title: Clinical Quality Language Tests
---

The following contains a zip file that contains a set of unit tests for Clinical Quality Language functionality.

The tests are expressed in a simple XML format describing the expression and its expected outcome.

The XML Schema for these tests is included in the zip.

This is the same test format used by the FHIRPath specification.

<a href="tests.zip">Test Source</a>.

Note that these tests have not been fully updated to the 1.4 specification.

At this point, the tests cover the following sections of the specification:

* Aggregate Functions
* Arithmetic Functions
* Comparison Operators
* Conditional Operators
* Date/Time Operators
* Errors And Messaging Operators
* Interval Operators
* List Operators
* Logical Operators
* Nullological Operators
* String Operators
* Type Operators
* Types
* Value Literals and Selectors

The tests defined here are informative, not normative aspects of the specification. If there is a discrepancy between the behavior of a test and the specification, the specification should be considered the source of truth.
