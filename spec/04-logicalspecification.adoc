This chapter describes the Expression Logical Model (ELM) and how it is used to represent clinical knowledge within a quality artifact.

The ELM defines a mechanism for representing artifact logic independent of syntax and special-purpose constructs introduced at the syntactic level. ELM is equivalent to CQL syntax in terms of expressive power: every possible expression in CQL has an equivalent canonical-form expression in ELM. Higher-level constructs such as timing phrases and implicit conversions are represented in terms of the more primitive operators in ELM. This takes the burden of interpretation of higher-level constructs off of implementers, allowing them to focus on the implementation of a more primitive set of functionality.

Expressions within ELM are represented as Abstract Syntax Trees. ELM defines the base _Expression_ class, and all language elements and operators are then defined as descendants of the base _Expression_. For example, the _Add_ class descends from _BinaryExpression_, which introduces two operands, each of type _Expression_. The _Literal_ class descends from _Expression_ and allows primitive-typed values such as strings and integers to be represented directly. Using these classes, the expression 2 [.sym]#+# 2 can be represented as instances of the appropriate classes:

Figure 4‑A - A diagram to explain how ELM represents addition of 2 literal values

By combining instances of the appropriate classes of ELM, the logic for any expression can be represented. Note that the type of the expression can be inferred from the representation, Integer in this example.

The ELM consists of the following components:

* Expression – This component defines the core structures for representing expressions, as well as the operations available within those expressions.
* Clinical Expression – This component extends the Expression component to introduce expressions specific to the clinical quality domain.
* Library – This component defines the structure of a library, the container, and the basic unit of sharing.

Each of these components is defined fully within the ELM UML model. This model is defined formally as an XMI, and the model definition is also presented as an Enterprise Architect Project file (.eap) for viewing.

* link:elm/model/elm.xmi[Raw XMI Model Definition]
* link:elm/model/ELM.eap[Raw EAP Model Definition]

The documentation provided here serves only as a high-level structural reference for the ELM. The actual content of the specification is defined by the XMI file, and that provides the “source-of-truth” for the ELM specification.

Note that the semantics for the operations described here are defined both in the UML model as comments on the node for each operator, as well as the equivalent CQL operation as defined in link:09-b-cqlreference.html[Appendix B – CQL Reference].

[[simple-values]]
== Simple Values

Support for simple values is provided by the _Literal_ class. This class defines properties to represent the type of the value, as well as the value itself.

=== Literal

[source,elm]
----
Literal : Expression
  ¦
  1..1 --> valueType
  ¦
  0..1 --> value
----

The Literal type defines a single scalar value. For example, the literal 5, the boolean value true or the string "antithrombotic".

[[structured-values]]
== Structured Values

Structured values in ELM are values with sets of named elements (tuples), each of which may have a value of any type. Structured values are most commonly used to represent clinical information such as encounters, problems, and procedures.

The _Tuple_ class represents construction of a new structured value, with the values for each element supplied by _TupleElement_ instances.

To access elements of a structured value, use the _Property_ expression. A property expression has a _path_ attribute, an optional _source_ element, and a _value_ element. The source element returns the structured value to be accessed. In some usages, such as within a _Filter_ expression, the source is implicit. If used outside such a usage, a source must be provided.

The path attribute specifies a property path relative to the source structured value. The property expression returns the value of the property specified by the property path. Property paths are allowed to include qualifiers ([.sym]#.#) as well as indexers ([.sym]#[x]#) to indicate that subelements should be traversed. Indexers specified in paths must be literal integer values.

=== Tuple

[source,elm]
----
Tuple : Expression
  ¦
  0..* --> element : TupleElement
----

The Tuple expression allows tuples of any type to be built up as an expression. The tupleType attribute specifies the type of the tuple being built, if any, and the list of tuple elements specify the values for the elements of the tuple. Note that the value of an element may be any expression, including another Tuple.

The following example illustrates the construction of a tuple using the _Tuple_ class:

[[figure-4-h]]
image:extracted-media/media/image17.png[image,width=190,height=157]

Figure 4‑H - A diagram to explain how ELM represents the construction of a [.kw]#Tuple#

=== Instance

[source,elm]
----
Instance : Expression
  ¦
  0..* --> element : InstanceElement
  ¦
  1..1 --> classType
----

The Instance expression allows class instances of any type to be built up as an expression. The classType attribute specifies the type of the class instance being built, and the list of instance elements specify the values for the elements of the class instance. Note that the value of an element may be any expression, including another Instance.

The following example illustrates the construction of a structured value using the _Instance_ class:

[[figure-4-i]]
image:extracted-media/media/image18.png[image,width=184,height=152]

Figure 4‑I - A diagram to explain how ELM represents the construction of a structured value using the [.kw]#Instance# class

=== Property

[source,elm]
----
Property : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> source : Expression
  ¦
  1..1 --> path
  ¦
  0..1 --> scope
----

The Property operator returns the value of the property on source specified by the path attribute.

If the result of evaluating source is null, the result is null.

The path attribute may include qualifiers (.) and indexers ([x]). Indexers must be literal integer values.

If the path attribute contains qualifiers or indexers, each qualifier or indexer is traversed to obtain the actual value. If the object of the property access at any point in traversing the path is null, the result is null.

If a scope is specified, the name is used to resolve the scope in which the path will be resolved. Scopes can be named by operators such as Filter and ForEach.

Property expressions can also be used to access the individual points and closed indicators for interval types using the property names low, high, lowClosed, and highClosed.

[[clinical-values]]
== Clinical Values

The following represents clinical information in ELM.

=== Code

[source,elm]
----
Code : Expression

<1> The code system that contains the code being referenced.

The CodeDef type defines a code identifier that can then be used to reference single codes anywhere within an expression.

=== CodeRef

[source,elm]
----
CodeRef : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> name
  ¦
  0..1 --> libraryName
----

The CodeRef expression allows a previously defined code to be referenced within an expression.

=== CodeSystemDef

[source,elm]
----
CodeSystemDef : Element
  ¦
  1..1 --> name
  ¦
  1..1 --> id
  ¦
  0..1 --> version
  ¦
  0..1 --> accessLevel
----

The CodeSystemDef type defines a code system identifier that can then be used to identify code systems involved in value set definitions.

=== CodeSystemRef

[source,elm]
----
CodeSystemRef : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> name
  ¦
  0..1 --> libraryName
----

The CodeSystemRef expression allows a previously defined named code system to be referenced within an expression. Conceptually, referencing a code system returns the set of codes in the code system. Note that this operation should almost never be performed in practice. Code system references are allowed in order to allow for testing of code membership in a particular code system.

=== Concept

[source,elm]
----
Concept : Expression
  ¦
  1..* --> code : Code
  ¦
  0..1 --> display
----

The Concept type represents a literal concept selector.

=== Quantity

[source,elm]
----
Quantity : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> value
  ¦
  0..1 --> unit
----

The Quantity type defines a clinical quantity. For example, the quantity 10 days or 30 mmHg. The value is a decimal, while the unit is expected to be a valid UCUM unit or calendar duration keyword, singular or plural.

=== Ratio

[source,elm]
----
Ratio : Expression
  ¦
  1..1 --> numerator : Quantity
  ¦
  1..1 --> denominator : Quantity
----

The Ratio type defines a ratio between two quantities. For example, the titre 1:128, or the concentration ratio 5 mg/10 mL. The numerator and denominator are both quantities.

=== ValueSetDef

[source,elm]
----
ValueSetDef : Element
  ¦
  0..* --> codeSystem : CodeSystemRef <1>
  ¦
  0..1 --> name
  ¦
  1..1 --> id
  ¦
  0..1 --> version
  ¦
  0..1 --> accessLevel
----

<1> The code system that should be used to construct the expansion set. Note that the recommended approach to statically binding to an expansion set is to use a value set definition that specifies the version of each code system used. The codeSystem elements are provided only to ensure static binding can be achieved when the value set definition does not specify code system versions as part of the definition header.

The ValueSetDef type defines a value set identifier that can be referenced by name anywhere within an expression.

The id specifies the globally unique identifier for the value set. This may be an HL7 OID, a FHIR URL, or a CTS2 value set URL.

If version is specified, it will be used to resolve the version of the value set definition to be used. Otherwise, the most current published version of the value set is assumed.

If codeSystems are specified, they will be used to resolve the code systems used within the value set definition to construct the expansion set.
Note that the recommended approach to statically binding to an expansion set is to use a value set definition that specifies the version of each code system used. The codeSystemVersions attribute is provided only to ensure static binding can be achieved when the value set definition does not specify code system versions as part of the definition header.

=== ValueSetRef

[source,elm]
----
ValueSetRef : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> name
  ¦
  0..1 --> libraryName
----

The ValueSetRef expression allows a previously defined named value set to be referenced within an expression. Conceptually, referencing a value set returns the expansion set for the value set as a list of codes.

[[type-specifiers]]
== Type Specifiers

ELM provides the following elements for type specifiers.

=== TypeSpecifier

[source,elm]
----
TypeSpecifier : Element

=== IntervalTypeSpecifier

[source,elm]
----
IntervalTypeSpecifier : TypeSpecifier
  ¦
  1..1 --> pointType : TypeSpecifier
----

IntervalTypeSpecifier defines an interval type by specifying the point type. Any type can serve as the point type for an interval, so long as it supports comparison operators, minimum and maximum value determination, as well as predecessor and successor functions.

  ¦
  0..* --> type : TypeSpecifier <1>
  ¦
  0..* --> choice : TypeSpecifier
----

<1> This element is deprecated. New implementations should use the new choice element.

ChoiceTypeSpecifier defines the possible types of a choice type.

[[libraries-2]]
== Libraries

ELM defines the notion of a library as the basic container for logic constructs. Libraries consist of sets of declarations including data model references, library references, valueset definitions, parameters, functions, and named expressions. The _Library_ class defines this unit and defines properties for each of these types of declarations.

Once defined, libraries can then be referenced by other libraries with the _IncludeDef_ class, which defines properties for the name and version of the library being referenced, as well as a local name that is used to access components of the library.

[[library]]
=== Library

[source,elm]
----
Library : Element
  ¦
  1..1 --> identifier : VersionedIdentifier <1>
  ¦
  1..1 --> schemaIdentifier : VersionedIdentifier <2>
  ¦

  ¦
  0..1 --> statements <13>
           ¦
           0..* --> def : ExpressionDef
----

<1> The identifier element defines a unique identifier for this library, and optionally, a system (or namespace) and version.

<2> This is the identifier of the XML schema (and its version) which governs the structure of this Library.

<3> Set of data models referenced in the Expression objects in this knowledge artifact.

<4> A reference to a data model that is used in the artifact, e.g., the Virtual Medical Record.

A Library is an instance of a CQL-ELM library.

=== IncludeDef

[source,elm]
----
IncludeDef : Element
  ¦
  1..1 --> localIdentifier
  ¦
  0..1 --> mediaType
  ¦
  1..1 --> path
  ¦
  0..1 --> version
----

Includes a library for use within the artifact.

=== VersionedIdentifier

[source,elm]
----
VersionedIdentifier
  ¦
  0..1 --> id
  ¦
  0..1 --> system
  ¦
  0..1 --> version
----

VersionedIdentifier is composed of three parts: (1) an optional system, or
  namespace, which provides a globally unique, stable scope for the identifier,
  (2) an identifier which identifies the set of all versions of a given resource, and
  (3) the actual version of the instance of interest in this set. The VersionedIdentifier
  therefore points to an individual 'versioned' instance of a resource such as the third
  version of a library.

=== ContextDef

[source,elm]
----
ContextDef : Element
  ¦
  1..1 --> name <1>
----

<1> The name of the context

The ContextDef type defines a context used within the library.

[[data-model]]
== Data Model

ELM does not reference any specific data model, and so can be used to represent logic expressed against any data model. These data models are specified using the _UsingDef_ class. This class provides attributes for specifying the name and version of the data model. An ELM library can reference any number of models.

The name of the model is an implementation-specific identifier that provides the environment with a mechanism for finding the model description. The details of how that model description is provided are part of the physical representation.

=== UsingDef

[source,elm]
----
UsingDef : Element
  ¦
  1..1 --> localIdentifier
  ¦
  1..1 --> uri
  ¦
  0..1 --> version
----

Defines a data model that is available within the artifact.

[[parameters]]
== Parameters

In addition to external data, ELM provides a mechanism for defining parameters to an artifact. A library can define any number of parameters, each of which has a name, and a defined type, as well as an optional default value.

Parameter values, if any, are expected to be provided as part of the evaluation request, and can be accessed with a _ParameterRef_ expression in any expression throughout the library.

=== ParameterDef

[source,elm]
----
ParameterDef : Element
  ¦
  0..1 --> default : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> parameterTypeSpecifier : TypeSpecifier
  ¦
  0..1 --> name
  ¦
  0..1 --> parameterType
  ¦
  0..1 --> accessLevel
----

The ParameterDef type defines a parameter that can be referenced by name anywhere within an expression.

Parameters are defined at the artifact level, and may be provided as part of the payload for an evaluation request.

If no parameter value is provided, the default element is used to provide the value for the parameter.

If no parameter or default is provided, the parameter is defined to be null.

Note that the expression specified in the default element must be able to be evaluated at compile-time (i.e. without reference to any run-time capabilities such as data, terminology, and library references, both local and included).

=== ParameterRef

[source,elm]
----
ParameterRef : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> name
  ¦
  0..1 --> libraryName
----

The ParameterRef expression allows the value of a parameter to be referenced as part of an expression.

[[expressions]]
== Expressions

The ELM Expression component defines a mechanism for representing the structure of logic.

Every expression in ELM is represented as a descendant of the abstract base element _Expression_. In addition, several abstract descendants are introduced to support the representation of unary, binary, ternary, and n-ary operators. Note that an expression need not descend from one of these descendants, it may descend from _Expression_ directly.

=== Expression

[source,elm]
----
Expression : Element
----

The Expression type defines the abstract base type for all expressions used in the ELM expression language.

=== OperatorExpression

[source,elm]
----
OperatorExpression : Expression
  ¦
  0..* --> signature : TypeSpecifier <1>
----

<1> Specifies the declared signature of the operator or function being called. If no signature is specified, the run-time types of the operands should be used to resolve any overload.

The Operator type defines the abstract base type for all built-in operators used in the ELM expression language. This explicitly excludes FunctionRef, which is the concrete type for all function invocations.

=== UnaryExpression

[source,elm]
----
UnaryExpression : OperatorExpression
  ¦
  1..1 --> operand : Expression
----

The UnaryExpression type defines the abstract base type for expressions that take a single argument.

=== BinaryExpression

[source,elm]
----
BinaryExpression : OperatorExpression
  ¦
  2..2 --> operand : Expression
----

The BinaryExpression type defines the abstract base type for expressions that take two arguments.

=== TernaryExpression

[source,elm]
----
TernaryExpression : OperatorExpression
  ¦
  3..3 --> operand : Expression
----

The TernaryExpression type defines the abstract base type for expressions that take three arguments.

=== NaryExpression

[source,elm]
----
NaryExpression : OperatorExpression
  ¦
  0..* --> operand : Expression
----

The NaryExpression type defines an abstract base class for an expression that takes any number of arguments, including zero.

=== AggregateExpression

[source,elm]
----
AggregateExpression : Expression
  ¦
  0..* --> signature : TypeSpecifier <1>
  ¦
  1..1 --> source : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> path
----

<1> Specifies the declared signature of the operator or function being called. If no signature is specified, the run-time types of the operands should be used to resolve any overload.

Aggregate expressions perform operations on lists of data, either directly on a list of scalars, or indirectly on a list of objects, with a reference to a property present on each object in the list.

Aggregate expressions deal with missing information by excluding missing values from consideration before performing the aggregated operation. For example, in a Sum over Dose, any instance of Medication with no value for Dose would be ignored.

An aggregate operation performed over an empty list is defined to return null, except as noted in the documentation for each operator (Count, AllTrue, and AnyTrue are the exceptions).

[[reusing-logic]]
== Reusing Logic

ELM provides a mechanism for reusing expressions by declaring a named expression. This construct is similar to a function call with no parameters in a traditional imperative language, with the exception that since ELM is a pure-functional system, the result of the evaluation could be cached by an implementation to avoid performing the same computation multiple times.

In addition, ELM provides a more traditional function call with named parameters that can then be accessed by the expression in the function body, and passed as part of the call from the invoking environment.

The _ExpressionDef_ class is used to define a named expression that can then be referenced by other expressions. The _FunctionDef_ class is used to define a function and its parameters.

Note that circular expression references are not allowed, but that named expressions can be defined in any order, so long as the actual references do not result in a cycle.

The _ExpressionDef_ class introduces the notion of _context_ which specifies the name of a context defined by the model, such as Patient, Practitioner, or Unfiltered. This context defines how the contained expression is evaluated, either with respect to a single subject, defined by the evaluation environment, or with respect to the entire system. For more information about patient context, please refer to the <<External Data>> section.

=== ExpressionDef

[source,elm]
----
ExpressionDef : Element
  ¦
  0..1 --> expression : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> name
  ¦
  0..1 --> context
  ¦
  0..1 --> accessLevel
----

The ExpressionDef type defines an expression and an associated name that can be referenced by any expression in the artifact. The name must be unique within the artifact.

The context attribute specifies the context of the execution and is used by the environment to determine whether or not to filter the data returned from retrieves based on the current context.

=== ExpressionRef

[source,elm]
----
ExpressionRef : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> name
  ¦
  0..1 --> libraryName
----

The ExpressionRef type defines an expression that references a previously defined NamedExpression. The result of evaluating an ExpressionReference is the result of evaluating the referenced NamedExpression.

=== FunctionDef

[source,elm]
----
FunctionDef : ExpressionDef
  ¦
  0..* --> operand : OperandDef
  ¦
  0..1 --> external
  ¦
  0..1 --> fluent
----

The FunctionDef type defines a named function that can be invoked by any expression in the artifact. Function names must be unique within the artifact. Functions may take any number of operands.

=== FunctionRef

[source,elm]
----
FunctionRef : ExpressionRef
  ¦
  0..* --> signature : TypeSpecifier <1>
  ¦
  0..* --> operand : Expression
----

<1> Specifies the declared signature of the function being called. If no signature is specified, the run-time types of the operands should be used to resolve any overload.

The FunctionRef type defines an expression that invokes a previously defined function. The result of evaluating each operand is passed to the function.

[[queries]]
== Queries

ELM provides a mechanism for expressing the structure of a query.

For more information on query semantics, refer to the <<02-authorsguide.adoc#queries,Queries>> section of the link:02-authorsguide.html[Author’s Guide], as well as the <<03-developersguide.adoc#multi-source-queries,Multi-Source Queries>> and <<03-developersguide.adoc#non-retrieve-queries,Non-Retrieve Queries>> sections of the link:03-developersguide.html[Developer’s Guide].

=== AliasedQuerySource

[source,elm]
----
AliasedQuerySource : Element
  ¦
  1..1 --> expression : Expression
  ¦
  1..1 --> alias
----

The AliasedQuerySource element defines a single source for inclusion in a query scope. The type of the source is determined by the expression element, and the source can be accessed within the query scope by the given alias.

=== AliasRef

[source,elm]
----
AliasRef : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> name
----

The AliasRef expression allows for the reference of a specific source within the scope of a query.

=== ByColumn

[source,elm]
----
ByColumn : SortByItem
  ¦
  0..1 --> path
----

The ByColumn element specifies that the sort should be performed using the given column and direction. This approach is used to specify the sort order for a query when the result is a list of tuples.

=== ByDirection

[source,elm]
----
ByDirection : SortByItem
----

The ByDirection element specifies that the sort should be performed using the given direction. This approach is used when the result of the query is a list of non-tuple elements and only the sort direction needs to be specified.

=== ByExpression

[source,elm]
----
ByExpression : SortByItem
  ¦
  1..1 --> expression : Expression
----

The ByExpression element specifies that the sort should be performed using the given expression and direction. This approach is used to specify the sort order as a calculated expression.

=== LetClause

[source,elm]
----
LetClause : Element

Without : RelationshipClause
----

The Without clause restricts the elements of a given source to only those elements that do not have elements in the related source that satisfy the suchThat condition. This operation is known as a semi-difference in database languages.

[[external-data]]
== External Data

All access to external data within ELM is represented by _Retrieve_ expressions.

The _Retrieve_ class defines the data type of the request, which determines the type of elements to be returned. The result will always be a list of values of the type specified in the request.

The type of the elements to be returned is specified with the _dataType_ attribute of the _Retrieve_, and must refer to the name of a type within a known data model specified in the _dataModels_ element of the library definition.

In addition, the _Retrieve_ introduces the ability to specify optional criteria for the request. The available criteria are intentionally restricted to the set of codes involved, and the date range involved. If these criteria are omitted, the request is interpreted to mean all data of that type.

Note that because every expression is being evaluated within a context (such as Patient, Practitioner, or Unfiltered) as defined by the containing _ExpressionDef_, the data returned by a retrieve depends on the context. For example, for the Patient context, the data is returned for a single patient only, as defined by the evaluation environment. Whereas for the Unfiltered context, the data is returned for the entire source.

The retrieve expression defines clinical data that will be used by the artifact. This expression allows clinically relevant filtering criteria to be provided in a well-defined and computable way. This operation defines the integration boundary for artifacts. The result of a retrieve is defined to return the same data for subsequent invocations within the same evaluation request. This means in particular that patient data updates made during the evaluation request are not visible to the artifact. In effect, the patient data is a snapshot of the data as of the start of the evaluation. This ensures strict deterministic and functional behavior of the artifact, and allows the implementation engine freedom to cache intermediate results in order to improve performance.

==== id
The id element optionally specifies an expression that results in a value that can be used to filter the retrieve to a specific id.

==== codes
The codes element optionally specifies an expression that results in a List<Code> to match against. Only those clinical statements that match at least one of the specified codes will be returned.

==== dateRange
The dateRange element optionally specifies an expression that results in an Interval<DateTime> to match against. Only those clinical statements whose date falls within the specified date range will be returned.

==== context
If specified, the context element references an expression that, when evaluated, provides the context for the retrieve. The expression evaluates to the instance id that will be used as the context for the retrieve.

==== include
Specifies a related data type to be included in the result as part of the retrieve.

==== dataType
The dataType attribute specifies the type of data being requested.

==== templateId
For data models that support templates (also called profiles), The templateId attribute specifies an optional template to be used. If specified, the retrieve is defined to return only objects that conform to the template.

==== idProperty
The idProperty attribute specifies which property of the model contains the Id for the clinical statement.

This property may be specified as a path, including qualifiers and constant indexers. The <simplePath> production rule in the CQL grammar provides the formal semantics for this path.

==== idSearch
The idSearch attribute specifies the name of the search path to use for searching for the values in the id element.

==== contextProperty
The contextProperty attribute optionally specifies which property of the model contains the context value.

Note that implementers could also specify this information elsewhere as part of an implementation catalog, rather than on each Retrieve expression, but allowing it to be specified in the retrieve expression gives the most flexibility. Note also that even in the case of an implementation catalog, implementations would still need to respect contextProperty values in the ELM due to the possibility of the retrieve specifying alternate context paths. From the persepctive of ELM, the specification ensures that ELM can be processed without reference to the model information.

This property may be specified as a path, including qualifiers and constant indexers. The &lt;simplePath&gt; production rule in the CQL grammar provides the formal semantics for this path.

==== contextSearch
The contextSearch attribute specifies the name of the search path to use for searching for the context values.

==== codeProperty
The codeProperty attribute optionally specifies which property of the model contains the Code or Codes for the clinical statement.

Note that implementers could also specify this information elsewhere as part of an implementation catalog, rather than on each Retrieve expression, but allowing it to be specified in the retrieve expression gives the most flexibility. Note also that even in the case of an implementation catalog, implementations would still need to respect codeProperty values in the ELM due to the possibility of the retrieve specifying alternate code filters. From the perspective of ELM, the specification ensures that ELM can be processed without reference to the model information.

This property may be specified as a path, including qualifiers and constant indexers. The <simplePath> production rule in the CQL grammar provides the formal semantics for this path.

==== codeSearch
The codeSearch attribute specifies the name of the search path to use for searching for the values in the code element.

==== codeComparator
The codeComparator attribute specifies how elements of the code property should be matched to the terminology. One of 'in', '=', or '~'. Note that 'in' will resolve to the appropriate terminology matching operator, resulting in equivalence semantics for value set and code system membership testing.

==== valueSetProperty
The valueSetProperty attribute optionally specifies which property of the model contains a value set identifier that can be used as an alternative mechanism for matching the value set of the retrieve, in the case when no code is specified in the source data.

This attribute is intended to address the case where systems representing negation rationale for an activity not performed do so by indicating a valueset identifier rather than a code. For example, when indicating that a medication was not administered, the value set identifier for the expected medication is used, rather than indicating a specific medication that was not administered. In this case, the valueSetProperty attribute allows the retrieve to specify where to look for the value set identifier without needing to change the conceptual data model or the CQL logic describing the negated activity.

Note that implementers could also specify this information elsewhere as part of an implementation catalog, rather than on each Retrieve expression, but allowing it to be specified in the retrieve expression gives the most flexibility. From the perspective of ELM, the specification ensures that ELM can be processed without reference to the model information.

This property may be specified as a path, including qualifiers and constant indexers. The <simplePath> production rule in the CQL grammar provides the formal semantics for this path.

==== dateProperty
The dateProperty attribute optionally specifies which property of the model contains the clinically relevant date for the clinical statement.

This property is expected to reference a property that is either a Date or DateTime, or an interval of Date or DateTime. In either case, the result set will only include instances where the value of the dateProperty is during the date range. For Date or DateTime values, this means the date is both the same or after the beginning of the range, and the same or before the end of the range. For Date- or DateTime-based interval values, this means that the entire interval is included in the date range.

Instances with no value for the dateProperty will not be included in the result set if a date range is specified.

Note that if the dateProperty is specified, the dateLowProperty and dateHighProperty attributes must not be present. And conversely, if the dateLowProperty and dateHighProperty attributes are specified, the dateProperty must not be present. If specified, the dateLowProperty and dateHighProperty values will be used to construct an interval with inclusive boundaries for the date range.

This property may be specified as a path, including qualifiers and constant indexers. The <simplePath> production rule in the CQL grammar provides the formal semantics for this path.

==== dateLowProperty
The dateLowProperty attribute optionally specifies which property of the model contains the low component of the clinically relevant date for the clinical statement.

Note that if the dateProperty is specified, the dateLowProperty and dateHighProperty attributes must not be present. And conversely, if the dateLowProperty and dateHighProperty attributes are specified, the dateProperty must not be present.

This property may be specified as a path, including qualifiers and constant indexers. The <simplePath> production rule in the CQL grammar provides the formal semantics for this path.

==== dateHighProperty
The dateHighProperty attribute optionally specifies which property of the model contains the high component of the clinically relevant date for the clinical statement.

Note that if the dateProperty is specified, the dateLowProperty and dateHighProperty attributes must not be present. And conversely, if the dateLowProperty and dateHighProperty attributes are specified, the dateProperty must not be present.

This property may be specified as a path, including qualifiers and constant indexers. The <simplePath> production rule in the CQL grammar provides the formal semantics for this path.

==== dateSearch
The dateSearch attribute specifies the name of the search path to use for searching for values in the date range specified by the dateRange element.

[[includeelement]]
=== IncludeElement

The IncludeElement type specifies include information for an include within a retrieve.

==== relatedDataType

The relatedDataType attribute specifies the type of the related data being requested.

==== relatedProperty

The relatedProperty attribute specifies which property of the relatedDataType contains the relatedId for the clinical statement.

This property may be specified as a path, including qualifiers and constant indexers. The &lt;simplePath&gt; production rule in the CQL grammar provides the formal semantics for this path.

==== relatedSearch

The relatedSearch attribute specifies the name of the search path to use for searching for data of the relatedDataType.

==== isReverse

The isReverse attribute indicates that the include is reverse, i.e. that the relatedDataType is referencing the data being retrieved, rather than the retrieved data referencing the relatedDataType.

[[comparison-operators-1]]
== Comparison Operators

ELM defines a standard set of comparison operators for use with simple values. Each comparison operator takes two arguments of the same type, and returns a boolean indicating the result of the comparison. Note that for comparison operators, if either or both operands evaluate to null, the result of the comparison is _null_, not false.

For more information on the semantics of the various comparison operators, see the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#comparison-operators-4,Comparison Operators>> section of the link:09-b-cqlreference.html[CQL Reference].

[[equal]]
=== Equal

[source,elm]
----
Equal : BinaryExpression
----

The Equal operator returns true if the arguments are equal; false if the arguments are known unequal, and null otherwise. Equality semantics are defined to be value-based.

For simple types, this means that equality returns true if and only if the result of each argument evaluates to the same value.

For string values, equality is strictly lexical based on the Unicode values for the individual characters in the strings.

For decimal values, trailing zeroes are ignored.

For quantities, this means that the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of 'cm' and 'm' are comparable, but units of 'cm2' and 'cm' are not. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in a run-time error.

For ratios, this means that the numerator and denominator must be the same, using quantity equality semantics.

For tuple types, this means that equality returns true if and only if the tuples are of the same type, and the values for all elements that have values, by name, are equal.

For list types, this means that equality returns true if and only if the lists contain elements of the same type, have the same number of elements, and for each element in the lists, in order, the elements are equal using equality semantics, with the exception that null elements are considered equal.

For interval types, equality returns true if and only if the intervals are over the same point type, and they have the same value for the starting and ending points of the interval as determined by the Start and End operators.

For Date, DateTime, and Time values, the comparison is performed by considering each precision in order, beginning with years (or hours for time values). If the values are the same, comparison proceeds to the next precision; if the values are different, the comparison stops and the result is false. If one input has a value for the precision and the other does not, the comparison stops and the result is null; if neither input has a value for the precision or the last precision has been reached, the comparison stops and the result is true. For the purposes of comparison, seconds and milliseconds are combined as a single precision using a decimal, with decimal equality semantics.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

The following example illustrates a simple _Equal_ comparison:

[[figure-4-b]]

Figure 4‑B - A diagram to explain how ELM represents an equal comparison

[[equivalent]]
=== Equivalent

[source,elm]
----
Equivalent : BinaryExpression
----

The Equivalent operator returns true if the arguments are the same value, or if they are both null; and false otherwise.

With the exception of null behavior and the semantics for specific types defined below, equivalence is the same as equality.

For string values, equivalence returns true if the strings are the same value while ignoring case and locale, and normalizing whitespace. Normalizing whitespace means that all whitespace characters are treated as equivalent, with whitespace characters as defined in the whitespace lexical category.

For decimals, equivalent means the values are the same with the comparison done on values rounded to the precision of the least precise operand; trailing zeroes after the decimal are ignored in determining precision for equivalent comparison.

For quantities, equivalent means the values are the same quantity when considering unit conversion (e.g. 100 'cm' ~ 1 'm') and using decimal equivalent semantics for the value. Note that implementations are not required to support unit conversion and so are allowed to return null for equivalence of quantities with different units.

For ratios, equivalent means that the numerator and denominator represent the same ratio (e.g. 1:100 ~ 10:1000).

For tuple types, this means that two tuple values are equivalent if and only if the tuples are of the same type, and the values for all elements by name are equivalent.

For list types, this means that two lists are equivalent if and only if the lists contain elements of the same type, have the same number of elements, and for each element in the lists, in order, the elements are equivalent.

For interval types, this means that two intervals are equivalent if and only if the intervals are over the same point type, and the starting and ending points of the intervals as determined by the Start and End operators are equivalent.

For Date, DateTime, and Time values, the comparison is performed in the same way as it is for equality, except that if one input has a value for a given precision and the other does not, the comparison stops and the result is false, rather than null. As with equality, the second and millisecond precisions are combined and combined as a single precision using a decimal, with decimal equivalence semantics.

For Code values, equivalence is defined based on the code and system elements only. The display and version elements are ignored for the purposes of determining Code equivalence.

For Concept values, equivalence is defined as a non-empty intersection of the codes in each Concept.

Note that this operator will always return true or false, even if either or both of its arguments are null or contain null components.

=== Greater

[source,elm]
----
Greater : BinaryExpression
----

The Greater operator returns true if the first argument is greater than the second argument.

For comparisons involving quantities, the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of 'cm' and 'm' are comparable, but units of 'cm2' and 'cm' are not. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in a run-time error.

For Date, DateTime, and Time values, the comparison is performed by considering each precision in order, beginning with years (or hours for time values). If the values are the same, comparison proceeds to the next precision; if the first value is greater than the second, the result is true; if the first value is less than the second, the result is false; if one input has a value for the precision and the other does not, the comparison stops and the result is null; if neither input has a value for the precision or the last precision has been reached, the comparison stops and the result is false. For the purposes of comparison, seconds and milliseconds are combined as a single precision using a decimal, with decimal comparison semantics.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

The Greater operator is defined for the Integer, Long, Decimal, String, Date, DateTime, Time, and Quantity types.

=== GreaterOrEqual

[source,elm]
----
GreaterOrEqual : BinaryExpression
----

The GreaterOrEqual operator returns true if the first argument is greater than or equal to the second argument.

For comparisons involving quantities, the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of 'cm' and 'm' are comparable, but units of 'cm2' and 'cm' are not. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in a run-time error.

----

The Less operator returns true if the first argument is less than the second argument.

For comparisons involving quantities, the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of 'cm' and 'm' are comparable, but units of 'cm2' and 'cm' are not. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in a run-time error.

[[not-equal]]
=== NotEqual

[source,elm]
----
NotEqual : BinaryExpression
----

The NotEqual operator returns true if its arguments are not the same value.

The NotEqual operator is a shorthand for invocation of logical negation of the Equal operator.

[[logical-operators-1]]
== Logical Operators

ELM defines logical operators that can be used to combine the results of logical expressions. _And_ and _Or_ can be used to combine any number of results, and _Not_ can be used to invert the result of any expression.

Note that these operators are defined with 3-valued logic semantics, allowing the operators to deal consistently with missing information.

For more information on the semantics of these operators, refer to the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#logical-operators-3,Logical Operators>> section in the link:09-b-cqlreference.html[CQL Reference].

=== And

[source,elm]
----
And : BinaryExpression
----

The And operator returns the logical conjunction of its arguments. Note that this operator is defined using 3-valued logic semantics. This means that if either argument is false, the result is false; if both arguments are true, the result is true; otherwise, the result is null. Note also that ELM does not prescribe short-circuit evaluation.

The following example illustrates a simple _And_ expression:

[[figure-4-c]]
image:extracted-media/media/image12.png[image,width=138,height=217]

Figure 4‑C - A diagram to explain how ELM represents a simple [.kw]#And# expression

=== Implies

[source,elm]
----
Implies : BinaryExpression
----

The Implies operator returns the logical implication of its arguments. Note that this operator is defined using 3-valued logic semantics. This means that if the left operand evaluates to true, this operator returns the boolean evaluation of the right operand. If the left operand evaluates to false, this operator returns true. Otherwise, this operator returns true if the right operand evaluates to true, and null otherwise.

Note that implies may use short-circuit evaluation in the case that the first operand evaluates to false.

=== Not

[source,elm]
----
Not : UnaryExpression
----

The Not operator returns the logical negation of its argument. If the argument is true, the result is false; if the argument is false, the result is true; otherwise, the result is null.

=== Or

[source,elm]
----
Or : BinaryExpression
----

The Or operator returns the logical disjunction of its arguments. Note that this operator is defined using 3-valued logic semantics. This means that if either argument is true, the result is true; if both arguments are false, the result is false; otherwise, the result is null. Note also that ELM does not prescribe short-circuit evaluation.

=== Xor

[source,elm]
----
Xor : BinaryExpression
----

The Xor operator returns the exclusive or of its arguments. Note that this operator is defined using 3-valued logic semantics. This means that the result is true if and only if one argument is true and the other is false, and that the result is false if and only if both arguments are true or both arguments are false. If either or both arguments are null, the result is null.

[[nullological-operators]]
== Nullological Operators

ELM defines several nullological operators that are useful for dealing with potentially missing information. These are _Null, IsNull_, _IsTrue_, _IsFalse_, and _Coalesce_.

For more information on the semantics of these operators, refer to the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#nullological-operators-3,Nullological Operators>> section in the link:09-b-cqlreference.html[CQL Reference].

=== Null

[source,elm]
----
Null : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> valueType
----

The Null operator returns a null, or missing information marker. To avoid the need to cast this result, the operator is allowed to return a typed null.

=== Coalesce

[source,elm]
----
Coalesce : NaryExpression
----

The Coalesce operator returns the first non-null result in a list of arguments. If all arguments evaluate to null, the result is null. The static type of the first argument determines the type of the result, and all subsequent arguments must be of that same type.

=== IsFalse

[source,elm]
----
IsFalse : UnaryExpression
----

The IsFalse operator determines whether or not its argument evaluates to false. If the argument evaluates to false, the result is true; if the argument evaluates to true or null, the result is false.

=== IsNull

[source,elm]
----
IsNull : UnaryExpression
----

The IsNull operator determines whether or not its argument evaluates to null. If the argument evaluates to null, the result is true; otherwise, the result is false.

=== IsTrue

[source,elm]
----
IsTrue : UnaryExpression
----

The IsTrue operator determines whether or not its argument evaluates to true. If the argument evaluates to true, the result is true; if the argument evaluates to false or null, the result is false.

[[conditional-operators]]
== Conditional Operators

ELM defines several conditional expressions that can be used to return different values based on a condition, or set of conditions. These are the _If_ (conditional) expression, and the _Case_ expression.

The conditional expression allows a simple condition to be used to decide between one expression or another.

The case expression has two varieties, one that is equivalent to repeated conditionals, and one that allows a specific comparand to be identified and compared with each item to determine a result.

=== Case

[source,elm]
----
Case : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> comparand : Expression
  ¦
  1..* --> caseItem : CaseItem
  ¦
  1..1 --> else : Expression
----

The Case operator allows for multiple conditional expressions to be chained together in a single expression, rather than having to nest multiple If operators. In addition, the comparand operand provides a variant on the case that allows a single value to be compared in each conditional.

If a comparand is not provided, the type of each when element of the caseItems within the Case is expected to be boolean. If a comparand is provided, the type of each when element of the caseItems within the Case is expected to be of the same type as the comparand. An else element must always be provided.

The static type of the then argument within the first caseItem determines the type of the result, and the then argument of each subsequent caseItem and the else argument must be of that same type.

The following example illustrates a more complex multi-conditional _Case_ expression:

[[figure-4-e]]
image:extracted-media/media/image14.png[image,width=230,height=397]

Figure 4‑E - A diagram to explain how ELM represents a complex multi-conditional [.kw]#Case# expression

And finally, an equivalent comparand-based _Case_ expression:

[[figure-4-f]]

Figure 4‑F - A diagram to explain how ELM represents a comparand-base [.kw]#Case# expression

=== If

[source,elm]
----
If : Expression
  ¦
  1..1 --> condition : Expression
  ¦
  1..1 --> then : Expression
  ¦
  1..1 --> else : Expression
----

The If operator evaluates a condition, and returns the then argument if the condition evaluates to true; if the condition evaluates to false or null, the result of the else argument is returned. The static type of the then argument determines the result type of the conditional, and the else argument must be of that same type.

The following examples illustrates a simple _If_ expression (i.e. if / then / else):

[[figure-4-d]]
image:extracted-media/media/image13.png[image,width=143,height=193]

Figure 4‑D - A diagram to explain how ELM represents a simple [.kw]#If# expression

[[arithmetic-operators]]
== Arithmetic Operators

ELM provides a complete set of arithmetic operators to allow for manipulation of integer and real values within artifacts. In general, these operators have the expected semantics for arithmetic operators.

Note that if an operand evaluates to null, the result of the operation is defined to be null. This provides consistent semantics when dealing with missing information.

In general, operations that cause arithmetic overflow or underflow, or otherwise cannot be performed (such as division by 0) will result in null, rather than a run-time error.

For more information on the semantics of these operators, refer to the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#arithmetic-operators-4,Arithmetic Operators>> section in the link:09-b-cqlreference.html[CQL Reference].

=== Abs

[source,elm]
----
Abs : UnaryExpression
----

The Abs operator returns the absolute value of its argument.

When taking the absolute value of a quantity, the unit is unchanged.

If the argument is null, the result is null.

If the result of taking the absolute value of the input cannot be represented (e.g. Abs(minimum Integer)), the result is null.

The Abs operator is defined for the Integer, Long, Decimal, and Quantity types.

[[add]]
=== Add

[source,elm]
----
Add : BinaryExpression
----

The Add operator performs numeric addition of its arguments.

When adding quantities, the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of 'cm' and 'm' can be added, but units of 'cm2' and 'cm' cannot. The unit of the result will be the most granular unit of either input. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in a run-time error.

The Add operator is defined for the Integer, Long Decimal, and Quantity types. In addition, a time-valued Quantity can be added to a Date, DateTime or Time using this operator.

For Date, DateTime, and Time values, the operator returns the value of the first argument, incremented by the time-valued quantity, respecting variable length periods for calendar years and months.

For Date values, the quantity unit must be one of years, months, weeks, or days.

For DateTime values, the quantity unit must be one of years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

For Time values, the quantity unit must be one of hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

Note that as with any date and time operations, temporal units may be specified with either singular, plural, or UCUM units. However, to avoid the potential confusion of calendar-based date and time arithmetic with definite-duration date and time arithmetic, it is an error to attempt to add a definite-duration time-valued unit above seconds, a calendar duration must be used.

For precisions above seconds, any decimal portion of the time-valued quantity is ignored, since date/time arithmetic above seconds is performed with calendar duration semantics.

For partial date/time values where the time-valued quantity is more precise than the partial date/time, the operation is performed by converting the time-based quantity to the highest specified granularity in the first argument (truncating any resulting decimal portion) and then adding it to the first argument.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

If the result of the addition cannot be represented (i.e. arithmetic overflow), the result is null.

The following example illustrates a simple _Add_ expression:

[[subtract]]
=== Subtract

[source,elm]
----
Subtract : BinaryExpression
----

The Subtract operator performs numeric subtraction of its arguments.

When subtracting quantities, the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of 'cm' and 'm' can be subtracted, but units of 'cm2' and 'cm' cannot. The unit of the result will be the most granular unit of either input. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in a run-time error.

The Subtract operator is defined for the Integer, Long, Decimal, and Quantity types. In addition, a time-valued Quantity can be subtracted from a Date, DateTime, or Time using this operator.

For Date, DateTime, Time values, the operator returns the value of the first argument, decremented by the time-valued quantity, respecting variable length periods for calendar years and months.

For Date values, the quantity unit must be one of years, months, weeks, or days.

For DateTime values, the quantity unit must be one of years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

For Time values, the quantity unit must be one of hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

Note that as with any Date, Time, or DateTime operations, temporal units may be specified with either singular, plural, or UCUM units. However, to avoid the potential confusion of calendar-based date and time arithmetic with definite-duration date and time arithmetic, it is an error to attempt to subtract a definite-duration time-valued unit above seconds, a calendar duration must be used.

For precisions above seconds, any decimal portion of the time-valued quantity is ignored, since date/time arithmetic above seconds is performed with calendar duration semantics.

For partial date/time values where the time-valued quantity is more precise than the partial date/time, the operation is performed by converting the time-based quantity to the highest specified granularity in the first argument (truncating any resulting decimal portion) and then subtracting it from the first argument.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

If the result of the operation cannot be represented, the result is null.

=== Successor

The Successor operator is defined for the Integer, Long, Decimal, Date, DateTime, and Time types.

For Integer, Successor is equivalent to adding 1.

For Long, Successor is equivalent to adding 1L.

For Decimal, Successor is equivalent to adding the minimum precision value for the Decimal type, or 10^-08.

For Date, DateTime, and Time values, Successor is equivalent to adding a time-unit quantity for the lowest specified precision of the value. For example, if the DateTime is fully specified, Successor is equivalent to adding 1 millisecond; if the DateTime is specified to the second, Successor is equivalent to adding one second, etc.

If the argument is null, the result is null.

If the result of the operation cannot be represented, the result is null.

  ¦
  0..1 --> timezoneOffset : Expression
----

The DateTime operator constructs a DateTime value from the given components.

At least one component other than timezoneOffset must be specified, and no component may be specified at a precision below an unspecified precision. For example, hour may be null, but if it is, minute, second, and millisecond must all be null as well.

Although the milliseconds are specified with a separate component, seconds and milliseconds are combined and represented as a [.id]#Decimal# for the purposes of comparison.

If timezoneOffset is not specified, it is defaulted to the timezone offset of the evaluation request.

=== DateTimeComponentFrom

[source,elm]
----
DateTimeComponentFrom : UnaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

The DateTimeComponentFrom operator returns the specified component of the argument.

If the argument is null, the result is null.

The precision must be one of Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, or Millisecond. Note specifically that since there is variability how weeks are counted, Week precision is not supported, and will result in an error.

=== DifferenceBetween

[source,elm]
----
DifferenceBetween : BinaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

The DifferenceBetween operator returns the number of boundaries crossed for the specified precision between the first and second arguments. If the first argument is after the second argument, the result is negative. Because this operation is only counting boundaries crossed, the result is always an integer.

For Date values, precision must be one of Year, Month, Week, or Day.

For Time values, precision must be one of Hour, Minute, Second, or Millisecond.

For calculations involving weeks, Sunday is considered to be the first day of the week for the purposes of determining boundaries.

When calculating the difference between DateTime values with different timezone offsets, implementations should normalize to the timezone offset of the evaluation request timestamp, but only when the comparison precision is hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

Note that this operator can be implemented using Uncertainty as described in the CQL specification, Chapter 5, Precision-Based Timing.

For Date values, precision must be one of Year, Month, Week, or Day.

For Time values, precision must be one of Hour, Minute, Second, or Millisecond.

For calculations involving weeks, the duration of a week is equivalent to 7 days.

When calculating duration between DateTime values with different timezone offsets, implementations should normalize to the timezone offset of the evaluation request timestamp, but only when the comparison precision is hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

Note that this operator can be implemented using Uncertainty as described in the CQL specification, Chapter 5, Precision-Based Timing.

Refer to the <<not-equal,Not Equal section>> in the Comparison Operators.

=== Now

[source,elm]
----
Now : OperatorExpression
----

The Now operator returns the date and time of the start timestamp associated with the evaluation request. Now is defined in this way for two reasons:
1) The operation will always return the same value within any given evaluation, ensuring that the result of an expression containing Now will always return the same result.

2) The operation will return the timestamp associated with the evaluation request, allowing the evaluation to be performed with the same timezone offset information as the data delivered with the evaluation request.

=== SameAs

[source,elm]
----
SameAs : BinaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

The SameAs operator is defined for Date, DateTime, and Time values, as well as intervals.

For the Interval overloads, the SameAs operator returns true if the intervals start and end at the same value, using the semantics described in the Start and End operator to determine interval boundaries.

The SameAs operator compares two Date, DateTime, or Time values to the specified precision for equality. Individual component values are compared starting from the year component down to the specified precision. If all values are specified and have the same value for each component, then the result is true. If a compared component is specified in both dates, but the values are not the same, then the result is false. Otherwise the result is null, as there is not enough information to make a determination.

If no precision is specified, the comparison is performed beginning with years (or hours for time values) and proceeding to the finest precision specified in either input.

For Date values, precision must be one of year, month, or day.

For DateTime values, precision must be one of year, month, day, hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

For Time values, precision must be one of hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

Note specifically that due to variability in the way week numbers are determined, comparisons involving weeks are not supported.

When comparing DateTime values with different timezone offsets, implementations should normalize to the timezone offset of the evaluation request timestamp, but only when the comparison precision is hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

=== SameOrBefore

[source,elm]
----
SameOrBefore : BinaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

The SameOrBefore operator is defined for Date, DateTime, and Time values, as well as intervals.

For the Interval overload, the SameOrBefore operator returns true if the first interval ends on or before the second one starts. In other words, if the ending point of the first interval is less than or equal to the starting point of the second interval, using the semantics described in the Start and End operators to determine interval boundaries.

The SameOrBefore operator compares two Date, DateTime, or Time values to the specified precision to determine whether the first argument is the same or before the second argument. The comparison is performed by considering each precision in order, beginning with years (or hours for time values). If the values are the same, comparison proceeds to the next precision; if the first value is less than the second, the result is true; if the first value is greater than the second, the result is false; if either input has no value for the precision, the comparison stops and the result is null; if the specified precision has been reached, the comparison stops and the result is true.

If no precision is specified, the comparison is performed beginning with years (or hours for time values) and proceeding to the finest precision specified in either input.

For Date values, precision must be one of year, month, or day.

For DateTime values, precision must be one of year, month, day, hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

For Time values, precision must be one of hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

Note specifically that due to variability in the way week numbers are determined, comparisons involving weeks are not supported.

When comparing DateTime values with different timezone offsets, implementations should normalize to the timezone offset of the evaluation request timestamp, but only when the comparison precision is hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

In other words, if the starting point of the first interval is greater than or equal to the ending point of the second interval, using the semantics described in the Start and End operators to determine interval boundaries.

For the Date, DateTime, and Time overloads, this operator compares two Date, DateTime, or Time values to the specified precision to determine whether the first argument is the same or after the second argument. The comparison is performed by considering each precision in order, beginning with years (or hours for time values). If the values are the same, comparison proceeds to the next precision; if the first value is greater than the second, the result is true; if the first value is less than the second, the result is false; if either input has no value for the precision, the comparison stops and the result is null; if the specified precision has been reached, the comparison stops and the result is true.

If no precision is specified, the comparison is performed beginning with years (or hours for time values) and proceeding to the finest precision specified in either input.

For Date values, precision must be one of year, month, or day.

For DateTime values, precision must be one of year, month, day, hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

For Time values, precision must be one of hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

Note specifically that due to variability in the way week numbers are determined, comparisons involving weeks are not supported.

When comparing DateTime values with different timezone offsets, implementations should normalize to the timezone offset of the evaluation request timestamp, but only when the comparison precision is hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

The Time operator constructs a time value from the given components.

At least one component other than timezoneOffset must be specified, and no component may be specified at a precision below an unspecified precision. For example, minute may be null, but if it is, second, and millisecond must all be null as well.

Although the milliseconds are specified with a separate component, seconds and milliseconds are combined and represented as a [.id]#Decimal# for the purposes of comparison.

=== TimeFrom

[[interval-operators]]
== Interval Operators

ELM defines a complete set of operators for use in defining and manipulating interval values.

Constructing an interval is performed with the _Interval_ expression, which allows the beginning and ending of the interval to be specified, as well as whether the interval beginning and ending is exclusive (open), or inclusive (closed).

ELM defines support for basic operations on intervals including determining length, accessing interval properties, and determining interval boundaries.

ELM also supports complete operations involving comparisons of intervals, including equality, membership testing, and inclusion testing.

In addition, the language supports operators for combining and manipulating intervals.

Note that ELM does not include a definition for During because it is synonymous with IncludedIn.

For more information on the semantics of these operators, refer to the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#interval-operators-3,Interval Operators>> section in the link:09-b-cqlreference.html[CQL Reference].

=== Interval

----
Interval : Expression

  0..1 --> low : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> lowClosedExpression : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> high : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> highClosedExpression : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> lowClosed
  ¦
  0..1 --> highClosed
----

The Interval selector defines an interval value. An interval must be defined using a point type that supports comparison, as well as Successor and Predecessor operations, and Minimum and Maximum Value operations.

The low and high bounds of the interval may each be defined as open or closed. Following standard terminology usage in interval mathematics, an open interval is defined to exclude the specified point, whereas a closed interval includes the point. The default is closed, indicating an inclusive interval.

The low and high elements are both optional. If the low element is not specified, the low bound of the resulting interval is null. If the high element is not specified, the high bound of the resulting interval is null.

The static type of the low bound determines the type of the interval, and the high bound must be of the same type.

If the low bound of the interval is null and open, the low bound of the interval is interpreted as unknown, and computations involving the low boundary will result in null.

If the low bound of the interval is null and closed, the interval is interpreted to start at the minimum value of the point type, and computations involving the low boundary will be performed with that value.

If the high bound of the interval is null and open, the high bound of the interval is unknown, and computations involving the high boundary will result in null.

If the high bound of the interval is null and closed, the interval is interpreted to end at the maximum value of the point type, and computations involving the high boundary will be performed with that interpretation.

[[after-1]]
=== After

[source,elm]
----
After : BinaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

The After operator is defined for Intervals, as well as Date, DateTime, and Time values.

For the Interval overload, the After operator returns true if the first interval starts after the second one ends. In other words, if the starting point of the first interval is greater than the ending point of the second interval using the semantics described in the Start and End operators to determine interval boundaries.

For the Date, DateTime, and Time overloads, the After operator returns true if the first datetime is after the second datetime at the specified level of precision. The comparison is performed by considering each precision in order, beginning with years (or hours for time values). If the values are the same, comparison proceeds to the next precision; if the first value is greater than the second, the result is true; if the first value is less than the second, the result is false; if either input has no value for the precision, the comparison stops and the result is null; if the specified precision has been reached, the comparison stops and the result is false.

If no precision is specified, the comparison is performed beginning with years (or hours for time values) and proceeding to the finest precision specified in either input.

For Date values, precision must be one of year, month, or day.

For DateTime values, precision must be one of year, month, day, hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

For Time values, precision must be one of hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

Note specifically that due to variability in the way week numbers are determined, comparisons involving weeks are not supported.

When comparing DateTime values with different timezone offsets, implementations should normalize to the timezone offset of the evaluation request timestamp, but only when the comparison precision is hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

[[before-1]]
=== Before

[source,elm]
----
Before : BinaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

The Before operator is defined for Intervals, as well as Date, DateTime, and Time values.

For the Interval overload, the Before operator returns true if the first interval ends before the second one starts. In other words, if the ending point of the first interval is less than the starting point of the second interval, using the semantics described in the Start and End operators to determine interval boundaries.

For the Date, DateTime, and Time overloads, the comparison is performed by considering each precision in order, beginning with years (or hours for time values). If the values are the same, comparison proceeds to the next precision; if the first value is less than the second, the result is true; if the first value is greater than the second, the result is false; if either input has no value for the precision, the comparison stops and the result is null; if the specified precision has been reached, the comparison stops and the result is false.

If no precision is specified, the comparison is performed beginning with years (or hours for time values) and proceeding to the finest precision specified in either input.

For Date values, precision must be one of year, month, or day.

For DateTime values, precision must be one of year, month, day, hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

For Time values, precision must be one of hour, minute, second, or millisecond.

Note specifically that due to variability in the way week numbers are determined, comparisons involving weeks are not supported.

When comparing DateTime values with different timezone offsets, implementations should normalize to the timezone offset of the evaluation request timestamp, but only when the comparison precision is hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

=== Collapse

[source,elm]
----
Collapse : BinaryExpression
----

The Collapse operator returns the unique set of intervals that completely covers the ranges present in the given list of intervals. In other words, adjacent intervals within a sorted list are merged if they either overlap or meet.

The operation is performed by combining successive intervals in the input that either overlap or meet, using the semantics defined for the Overlaps and Meets operators. Note that because those operators are themselves defined in terms of interval successor and predecessor operators, sets of Date-, DateTime-, and Time-based intervals that are only defined to a particular precision will calculate meets and overlaps at that precision. For example, a list of DateTime-based intervals where the boundaries are all specified to the hour will collapse at the hour precision, unless the collapse precision is overridden with the per argument.

The per argument determines the precision at which the collapse is computed and must be a quantity-valued expression compatible with the interval point type. For numeric intervals, this means a quantity with the default unit '1' (not to be confused with the quantity value, which may be any valid positive decimal). For Date-, DateTime-, and Time-valued intervals, this means a quantity with a temporal unit (e.g., 'year', 'month', etc).

Conceptually, the per argument to the collapse operator partitions the value-space for the operation into units of size 'per', and the intervals will be collapsed aligning with those partitions. Note that the 'per' partitions start from the starting boundary of the first input interval, ordered.

If the per argument is null, a per value will be constructed based on the coarsest precision of the boundaries of the intervals in the input set. For example, a list of DateTime-based intervals where the boundaries are a mixture of hours and minutes will collapse at the hour precision.

If the list of intervals is empty, the result is empty. If the list of intervals contains a single interval, the result is a list with that interval. If the list of intervals contains nulls, they will be excluded from the resulting list.

If the source argument is null, the result is null.

[[contains]]
=== Contains

[source,elm]
----
Contains : BinaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

The Contains operator returns true if the first operand contains the second.

There are two overloads of this operator:
1. List, T : The type of T must be the same as the element type of the list.
2. Interval, T : The type of T must be the same as the point type of the interval.

For the List, T overload, this operator returns true if the given element is in the list, using equality semantics.

For the Interval, T overload, this operator returns true if the given point is equal to the starting or ending point of the interval, or greater than the starting point and less than the ending point. For open interval boundaries, exclusive comparison operators are used. For closed interval boundaries, if the interval boundary is null, the result of the boundary comparison is considered true. If precision is specified and the point type is a Date, DateTime, or Time type, comparisons used in the operation are performed at the specified precision.

If the first argument is null, the result is false. If the second argument is null, the result is null.

=== End

[source,elm]
----
End : UnaryExpression
----

The End operator returns the ending point of an interval.

If the high boundary of the interval is open, this operator returns the Predecessor of the high value of the interval. Note that if the high value of the interval is null, the result is null.

If the high boundary of the interval is closed and the high value of the interval is not null, this operator returns the high value of the interval. Otherwise, the result is the maximum value of the point type of the interval.

If the argument is null, the result is null.

=== Ends

[source,elm]
----
Ends : BinaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

The Ends operator returns true if the first interval ends the second. In other words, if the starting point of the first interval is greater than or equal to the starting point of the second, and the ending point of the first interval is equal to the ending point of the second.

This operator uses the semantics described in the Start and End operators to determine interval boundaries.

If precision is specified and the point type is a Date, DateTime, or Time type, comparisons used in the operation are performed at the specified precision.

If either argument is null, the result is null.

=== Equal

Refer to the <<equal,Equal section>> in the Comparison Operators.

=== Equivalent

Refer to the <<equivalent,Equivalent section>> in the Comparison Operators.

[[except]]
=== Except

[source,elm]
----
Except : NaryExpression
----

The Except operator returns the set difference of the two arguments.

This operator has two overloads:
1. List, List
2. Interval, Interval

For the list overload, this operator returns a list with the elements that appear in the first operand, that do not appear in the second operand, using equality semantics, with the exception that null elements are considered equal for the purposes of determining the result. The operator is defined with set semantics, meaning that each element will appear in the result at most once, and that there is no expectation that the order of the inputs will be preserved in the results.

For the interval overload, this operator returns the portion of the first interval that does not overlap with the second. If the second argument is properly contained within the first and does not start or end it, this operator returns null.

If the first argument is null, the result is null. If the second argument is null, the operation is performed as though the second argument was an empty list.

=== Expand

[source,elm]
----
Expand : BinaryExpression
----

The Expand operator returns the set of intervals of size per for all the ranges present in the given list of intervals, or the list of points covering the range of the given interval, if invoked on a single interval.

The per argument determines the size of the resulting intervals and must be a quantity-valued expression compatible with the interval point type. For numeric intervals, this means a quantity with the default unit '1' (not to be confused with the quantity value, which may be any valid positive decimal).  For Date-, DateTime-, and Time-valued intervals, this means a quantity with a temporal unit (e.g., 'year', 'month', etc).

Conceptually, the per argument to the expand operator partitions the value-space for the operation into units of size 'per', and the intervals will be expanded aligning with those partitions. Note that the 'per' partitions start from the starting boundary of the first input interval, ordered.

If the per argument is null, a per value will be constructed based on the coarsest precision of the boundaries of the intervals in the input set. For example, a list of DateTime-based intervals where the boundaries are a mixture of hours and minutes will expand at the hour precision.

Note that if the values in the intervals are more precise than the per quantity, the more precise values will be truncated to the precision specified by the per quantity.

If the input argument is an interval, rather than a list of intervals, the result is a list of points, rather than a list of intervals. In this case, the calculation is performed the same way, but the starting point of each resulting interval is returned, rather than the interval.

If the list of intervals is empty, the result is empty. If the list of intervals contains nulls, they will be excluded from the resulting list.

If the source argument is null, the result is null.

For the T, List overload, this operator returns true if the given element is in the given list, using equality semantics.

For the T, Interval overload, this operator returns true if the given point is equal to the starting or ending point of the interval, or greater than the starting point and less than the ending point. For open interval boundaries, exclusive comparison operators are used. For closed interval boundaries, if the interval boundary is null, the result of the boundary comparison is considered true. If precision is specified and the point type is a Date, DateTime, or Time type, comparisons used in the operation are performed at the specified precision.

If the first argument is null, the result is null. If the second argument is null the result is false.

[[list-operators]]
== List Operators

ELM allows for the expression and manipulation of lists of values of any type. The most basic list operation is the _List_ class, which represents a simple list selector.

Basic list operations include testing for membership, indexing, and content. ELM also supports comparison of lists, including equality and inclusion determination (subset/superset). Supported operations on single lists include filtering, sorting, and computation. For multiple lists, ELM supports combining through union and intersection, as well as computing the difference.

The use of the scope attribute allows for more complex expressions such as correlated subqueries.

ELM also supports a flattening operator, _Flatten_ to construct a single list from a list of lists.

[[aggregate-operators]]
== Aggregate Operators

For computing aggregate quantities, ELM defines several aggregate operators. These operators perform computations on lists of values, either on the elements of the list directly, or on a specific property of each element in the list.

Unless noted in the documentation for each operator, aggregate operators deal with missing information by excluding elements which have no value before performing the aggregation. In addition, an aggregate operation performed over an empty list is defined to return null, except as noted in the documentation for each operator (e.g. Count).

In general, operations that cause arithmetic overflow or underflow, or otherwise cannot be performed (such as division by 0) will result in null, rather than a run-time error.

For more information on the semantics of these operators, refer to the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#aggregate-functions,Aggregate Functions>> section in the link:09-b-cqlreference.html[CQL Reference].

If the argument is null, the result is null.

=== ToList

[source,elm]
----
ToList : UnaryExpression
----

The ToList operator returns its argument as a List value. The operator accepts a singleton value of any type and returns a list with the value as the single element.

If the argument is null, the operator returns an empty list.

The operator is effectively shorthand for "if operand is null then { } else { operand }".

The operator is used to implement list promotion efficiently.

=== ToLong

[source,elm]
----
ToLong : UnaryExpression
----

The ToLong operator converts the value of its argument to a Long value. The operator accepts strings using the following format:

*(+|-)?#0*

Meaning an optional polarity indicator, followed by any number of digits (including none), followed by at least one digit.

See <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#formatting-strings,Formatting Strings>> for a description of the formatting strings used in this specification.

Note that the long value returned by this operator must be a valid value in the range representable for Long values in CQL.

If the input string is not formatted correctly, or cannot be interpreted as a valid Long value, the result is null.

If the argument is null, the result is null.

=== ToQuantity

[source,elm]
----
ToQuantity : UnaryExpression
----

The ToQuantity operator converts the value of its argument to a Quantity value. The operator may be used with Integer, Decimal, Ratio, or String values. The operation does not perform any unit conversion, that capability is supported by the <<convertquantity,ConvertQuantity>> operator.

For String values, the operator accepts strings using the following format:

*(+|-)?\#0(.0#)?('<unit>')?*

Meaning an optional polarity indicator, followed by any number of digits (including none) followed by at least one digit, optionally followed by a decimal point, at least one digit, and any number of additional digits, all optionally followed by a unit designator as a string literal specifying a valid UCUM unit of measure or calendar duration keyword, singular or plural. Spaces are allowed between the quantity value and the unit designator.

Note that the decimal value of the quantity returned by this operator must be a valid value in the range representable for Decimal values in CQL.

If the input string is not formatted correctly, or cannot be interpreted as a valid Quantity value, the result is null.

For Integer and Decimal values, the result is a Quantity with the value of the integer or decimal input, and the default unit ('1').

For Ratio values, the operation is equivalent to the result of dividing the numerator of the ratio by the denominator.

If the argument is null, the result is null.

=== ToRatio

[source,elm]
----
ToRatio : UnaryExpression
----

The ToRatio operator converts the value of its argument to a Ratio value. The operator accepts strings using the following format:

*<quantity>:<quantity>*

Meaning a quantity, followed by a colon (:), followed by another quantity. The operator accepts quantity strings using the same format as the ToQuantity operator.

If the input string is not formatted correctly, or cannot be interpreted as a valid Ratio value, the result is null.

If the argument is null, the result is null.

=== ToString

[source,elm]
----
ToString : UnaryExpression
----

The ToString operator converts the value of its argument to a String value. The operator uses the following string representations for each type

[width="50%"]
|====
|Boolean |true\|false
|Integer |*(-)?#0*
|Long |*(-)?#0*
|Decimal |*(-)?\#0.0#*
|Quantity |*(-)?\#0.0# '<unit>'*
|Date |*YYYY-MM-DD*
|DateTime |*YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.fff(+\|-)hh:mm*
|Time	|*hh:mm:ss.fff*
|Ratio |*<quantity>:<quantity>*
|====

See <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#formatting-strings,Formatting Strings>> for a description of the formatting strings used in this specification.

If the argument is null, the result is null.

=== ToTime

[source,elm]
----
ToTime : UnaryExpression
----

The ToTime operator converts the value of its argument to a Time value.

For String values, the operator expects the string to be formatted using ISO-8601 time representation:

*hh:mm:ss.fff*

See <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#formatting-strings,Formatting Strings>> for a description of the formatting strings used in this specification.

In addition, the string must be interpretable as a valid time-of-day value.

If the input string is not formatted correctly, or does not represent a valid time-of-day value, the result is null.

As with time-of-day literals, time-of-day values may be specified to any precision.

For DateTime values, the result is the same as extracting the Time component from the DateTime value.

If the argument is null, the result is null.

[[clinical-operators]]
== Clinical Operators

For working with clinical data, ELM defines operators for terminology sets, quantities, and calculating age.

----

The AnyInCodeSystem operator returns true if any of the given codes are in the given code system.

The first argument is expected to be a list of String, Code, or Concept.

The second argument is expected to be of type CodeSystem. When this argument is statically a CodeSystemRef, this allows for both static analysis of the code system references within an artifact, as well as the implementation of code system membership by the target environment as a service call to a terminology server, if desired.

=== AnyInValueSet

[source,elm]
----
AnyInValueSet : OperatorExpression
  ¦
  1..1 --> codes : Expression
  ¦
  1..1 --> valueset : Expression
----

The AnyInValueSet operator returns true if any of the given codes are in the given value set.

The first argument is expected to be a list of String, Code, or Concept.

The second argument is expected to be of type ValueSet. When this argument is statically a ValueSetRef, this allows for both static analysis of the value set references within an artifact, as well as the implementation of valueset membership by the target environment as a service call to a terminology server, if desired.

=== CalculateAge

[source,elm]
----
CalculateAge : UnaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

Calculates the age in the specified precision of a person born on the given date.

The CalculateAge operator is defined for Date and DateTime.

For the Date overload, the calculation is performed using Today(), the precision must be one of year, month, week, or day, and the result is the number of whole calendar periods that have elapsed between the given date and today.

For the DateTime overload, the calculation is performed using Now(), and the result is the number of whole calendar periods that have elapsed between the given datetime and now.

=== CalculateAgeAt

[source,elm]
----
CalculateAgeAt : BinaryExpression
  ¦
  0..1 --> precision
----

Calculates the age in the specified precision of a person born on a given date, as of another given date.

The CalculateAgeAt operator has two signatures:
  (Date, Date)
  (DateTime, DateTime)

For the Date overload, precision must be one of year, month, week, or day, and the result is the number of whole calendar periods that have elapsed between the first date and the second date.

For the DateTime overload, the result is the number of whole calendar periods that have elapsed between the first datetime and the second datetime.

----

The InCodeSystem operator returns true if the given code is in the given code system.

The first argument is expected to be a String, Code, or Concept.

The second argument is expected to be of type CodeSystem. When this argument is statically a CodeSystemRef, this allows for both static analysis of the code system references within an artifact, as well as the implementation of code system membership by the target environment as a service call to a terminology server, if desired.

=== InValueSet

[source,elm]
----
InValueSet : OperatorExpression
  ¦
  1..1 --> code : Expression
  ¦
  1..1 --> valueset : Expression
----

The InValueSet operator returns true if the given code is in the given value set.

The first argument is expected to be a String, Code, or Concept.

The second argument is expected to be of type ValueSet. When this argument is statically a ValueSetRef, this allows for both static analysis of the value set references within an artifact, as well as the implementation of valueset membership by the target environment as a service call to a terminology server, if desired.

=== Not Equal

Refer to the <<not-equal,Not Equal section>> in the Comparison Operators.

=== SubsumedBy

[source,elm]
----
SubsumedBy : BinaryExpression
----

The SubsumedBy operator returns true if the given codes are equivalent, or if the first code is subsumed by the second code (i.e. the first code is a descendent of the second code in a subsumption hierarchy), and false otherwise.

For the Concept overload, this operator returns true if any code in the first concept is subsumed by any code in the second.

If either or both arguments are null, the result is null.

=== Subsumes

[source,elm]
----
Subsumes : BinaryExpression
----

The Subsumes operator returns true if the given codes are equivalent, or if the first code subsumes the second (i.e. the first code is an ancestor of the second in a subsumption hierarchy), and false otherwise.

For the Concept overload, this operator returns true if any code in the first concept subsumes any code in the second.

If either or both arguments are null, the result is null.

[[errors-and-messages]]
== Errors and Messages

ELM defines a utility operation that is useful for generating run-time messages, warnings, traces, and errors. The operator is a single, general-purpose function intended to provide a single implementation point for messaging and run-time error functionality when those messages are generated from ELM logic.

=== Message

[source,elm]
----
Message : OperatorExpression
  ¦
  1..1 --> source : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> condition : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> code : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> severity : Expression
  ¦
  0..1 --> message : Expression
----

The Message operator is used to support errors, warnings, messages, and tracing in an ELM evaluation environment.

The operator is defined to return the input source.

If the severity is Error, the operator is expected to raise a run-time error and return the message to the calling environment. This is the only severity that stops processing. All other severities continue evaluation of the expression.

If the severity is Trace, the operator is expected to make the message available to a tracing mechanism such as a debug log in the calling environment.

If the severity is Warning, the operator is expected to provide the message as a warning to the calling environment.

If the severity is Message, the operator is expected to provide the message as information to the calling environment.
