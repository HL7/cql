*HL7 Standard: Clinical Quality Language Specification, Release 1 STU 3 (CQL 1.3)*

*HL7 STU Specification*

Clinical Quality Language (CQL) is a high-level, domain-specific language focused on clinical quality and targeted at measure and decision support artifact authors.

In addition, this specification describes a machine-readable canonical representation called Expression Logical Model (ELM) targeted at implementations and designed to enable sharing of clinical knowledge.

== Organization of this Specification

The organization of this specification follows the outline of the perspectives discussed in the Approach section—conceptual, logical, and physical. Below is a listing of the chapters with a short summary of the content of each.

link:01-introduction.html[Chapter 1, role="anchor"] – Introduction provides introductory and background material for the specification.

link:02-authorsguide.html[Chapter 2] – Author’s Guide provides a high-level discussion of the Clinical Quality Language syntax. This discussion is a self-contained introduction to the language targeted at clinical quality authors.

link:03-developersguide.html[Chapter 3] – Developer’s Guide provides a more in-depth look at the Clinical Quality Language targeted at developers familiar with typical development languages such as Java, C#, and SQL.

link:04-logicalspecification.html[Chapter 4] – Logical Specification provides a complete description of the elements that can be used to represent quality logic. Note that Chapters 2 and 3 describe the same functional capabilities of the language, and that anything that can be expressed in one mechanism can be equivalently expressed in the other.

link:05-languagesemantics.html[Chapter 5] – Language Semantics describes the intended semantics of the language, covering topics such as data layer integration and expected run-time behavior.

link:06-translationsemantics.html[Chapter 6] – Translation Semantics describes the mapping between CQL and ELM, as well as outlines for how to perform translation from CQL to ELM, and vice versa.

link:07-physicalrepresentation.html[Chapter 7] – Physical Representation is reference documentation for the XML schema used to persist ELM.

link:08-a-cqlsyntax.html[Appendix A – CQL Syntax Formal Specification] discusses the ANTLR4 grammar for the Clinical Quality Language.

link:09-b-cqlreference.html[Appendix B] – CQL Reference provides a complete reference for the types and operators available in CQL, and is intended to be used by authors and developers alike.

link:10-c-referenceimplementations.html[Appendix C] – Reference Implementations provides information about where to find reference implementations for a CQL-ELM translator, a CQL Execution Framework for JavaScript, and other related tooling.
