This changelist describes the substantive changes, as well as a handful of more significant changes to the specification as a result of STU 3 comment reconciliation. For a complete list of changes, refer to the repository commit history and the ballot reconciliation spreadsheet.

* #30: Updated terminology identifiers to use URIs in examples throughout
* #36: Added discussion of code and concept declarations and literals
* #42: Specified duration of year as 365 days and month as 30 days when there is no anchor
* #43: Clarified that timezone offset normalization should only apply for time-based precisions
* #47: Added Date overloads for CalculateAge operators in ELM and CQL; AgeInYears and AgeInMonths use Date, AgeInWeeks and finer use DateTime
* #48: Added examples of Date-interval with open/closed boundaries
* #57: Added guidance on use of external functions
* #61: Added examples throughout
* #65: Added documentation of formatting strings
* #67: Clarified behavior of precision with between and other date/time functions
* #72: Added SplitOnMatches operator
* #73: Added discussion of potential pitfalls with uncertainty and date/time arithmetic
* #75: Added Concept overload for Equivalence
* #101: Updated ELM model
* #167: Clarified mixed-type signatures for interval and date/time operators and the semantics for interval promotion/demotion and when they are used
* #207: Added OperatorExpression type in ELM
* #214: Align with the FHIRPath normative ballot
* #215: Remove the ability to extract a week component
* #216: Remove the ability to say "same week as"
* #211: Symbolic date/time comparisons now occur at finest precision specified in either input
* #212: Remove unnecessary overloads of Divide and Multiply
* #217: Added choice-casting and interval promotion/demotion to conversion precedence
* #218: Added discussion of the option to require the from keyword for all queries
* #219: Changed date/time equality/comparison to return null only if the values have different levels of precision
* #220: Changed tuple equality to return null only if the values have different elements specified
* #221: Changed list membership and duplicate detection semantics throughout to use equality instead of equivalence
* #222: Add a per clause to the collapse operator
