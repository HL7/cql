This code system is intended to be a place to identify codes for messages that are indicated by the specification itself. Implementation-specific, application-specific, and content-specific codes may be provided with codes from other code systems, but should ideally map to some code (possibly a more general code) in this code system. This is the 'whole code system value set' for the CQL Message Codes code system.",
