# 1.2 Change Log
:page-layout: unversioned
:backend: xhtml

Update 2 Changes:

Adopted the FHIRPath.g4 grammar as the base expression grammar for the language

Expanded semantics to enable FHIRPath expressions:

* Added ability to invoke property accessors on a list
* Added $ and % identifier scopes
* Added implies operator
* Added | as a synonym for union
* Added & string concatenation operator
* Added promotion and demotion of lists
* Added options to support enabling aspects of FHIRPath functionality
* Added “method-style” invocation syntax
* Added rewrite rules for FHIRPath operations
* Added Repeat, Slice, StartsWith, EndsWith, Matches, ReplaceMatches, LastPositionOf, Children, and Descendents operations
* Applied “treat null as empty list” semantics for list operators (e.g. exists (null) now returns false, not null)
* Added ToList operator to support efficient list promotion

Corrected String concatenation mapping

Clarified runtime behavior for options on quantities with incompatible units
